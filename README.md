The_Hungry_Snake  🐍

**The Hungry Snake** 
is a simple web-based game inspired by the classic Snake game found on early mobile phones. Built as my first web app game it features smooth movement, score tracking, and collision detection. The game increases in difficulty as the snake grows longer with each piece of food it consumes.


## 🎮 Gameplay
- Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
- Eat the food (small squares) to grow the snake's length.
- Avoid crashing into the walls or your own body — if you do, the game ends.
- The score increases as you eat more food.
